hash function:
可能會產生碰撞,i.e.
Given H:hash function, ramdomly select x1, x2, then H(x1) = H(x2).

cryptographic hash:
satisfied therr properies
1. one-way
2. weak collision resistance
3. strong collision resistance
That is, Given H':cryptographic hash function,
it's very hard to find x1, x2 such that H(x1) = H(x2).
and it's very hard to find x3, x4 when given H(x3), H(x4).
